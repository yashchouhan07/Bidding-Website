## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFC107) to represent value and excitement, taking inspiration from the 'Auction Hub' image.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#191A32) for a premium and sophisticated look, matching the overall feel of the example image.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for UI elements, offering good contrast against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that has a modern and neutral look. The goal is to maintain clarity and readability throughout the site.
- Use outline style icons with a touch of gold to maintain consistency.
- Adopt a card-based layout to display product listings and categories. Match the layout of the inspiration image as closely as possible.
- Implement subtle transition effects during bidding to indicate the change in bid values and winning bidder.
